                    description: ' <p>This past week, Democratic presidential candidate and former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke put gun rights activists into a tizzy. He has proposed a ban on all assault weapons, a mandatory buyback of said rifles, and a voluntary buyback of <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/16/beto-orourke-buyback-gun-1466128">handguns</a>.</p> <p>Beto O’Rourke called Friday for gun licensing and a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons, expanding on a controversial gun control platform he advanced in his return to the presidential campaign the previous day.</p> <p>Part of a proposal to address gun violence and white nationalism, O’Rourke said that, if enacted, anyone who failed to forfeit a banned assault weapon would be fined.</p> In addition to banning assault weapons and requiring their forfeiture, O’Rourke said he would work to implement a voluntary buyback program for handguns. He proposed increasing the excise tax on gun manufacturers and fines on gun traffickers to fund buybacks. <p>Gun rights activists are sputtering all over Twitter, saying that every Democratic presidential candidate is in favor this proposal (which is not not true). The gun lovers also claim that this would entail confiscation of their firearms. That’s another obvious lie: If you are being given compensation for something, it is not confiscation. </p> <p>I have no sympathy for gun rights activists. They have turned our world upside down, without regard for the consequences. These are selfish people, only caring for their wants and treating gun ownership as an absolute right. It is not, and that part of the Second Amendment is often overlooked in regards to the debate over firearms. The entire text reads:</p> <p>"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."</p> <p>This is not talking about individual gun rights. It is talking about a militia, a militia that today is known as the National Guard. It also speaks of it being well-regulated. To argue that no laws can be imposed to restrict gun ownership is absurd. </p> <p>Gun rights activists could have avoided talk of gun buybacks and making certain weapon types illegal, had they just agreed to modest proposals about firearm safety. Had they not pushed and pushed for ever more lax laws, ee would not be at this point, where this is even a question. The rise in mass shootings is not because of mental health issues, it is not because of violent video games, nor is it because parents did not discipline their children. It is because of lax firearms laws, and easy access to guns that should not be in the hands of civilians.</p> <p>Gun rights activists will argue that the AR-15 and AK-47 rifles sold to the civilian market are not military firearms, as they do not fire fully automatic. Bullshit. I carried the M-16A1, and M-16A2, and have fired AK-47s. Their rate of fire, the ability to quickly change magazines, and the fact that their magazines can carry up to 100 rounds: those weapons aren’t something you use to hunt rabbits. That is a weapon that has one purpose: to kill and maim human beings. If you argue you need an AR-15 for hunting, you need a new hobby. Because you do not fire off 30 rounds in less than 30 seconds to shoot a rodent. If you want to argue that you need your AR-15 to protect yourself against a tyrannical U.S. government, I give you the M1A2 Abrams  </p> Trust me, your little peashooter isn’t even going to chip the paint on one of these. <p>I promise you, you are no match for that with your AR-15, or against the infantry that support it.</p> <p>The other argument that gun rights activists like to use is that criminals do not follow the law. I am not a lawyer, and I do not pretend to understand the nuances of law in society. So I asked <a href="https://abovethelaw.com/author/joe-patrice/?fbclid=IwAR3qgeVLEdYHqYBv5wCRJxvXNRMSKllAkkiwgwmt7VhmVfzVgDoW1TJqlkM" title="">Joe Patrice at Above the Law</a> about what laws are for, over and above preventing crime. This was his response:</p> <p>Someone is going to break every law. Criminals don’t follow laws against murder and no one suggests that’s a reason to legalize murder. </p> <p>There are a few schools of thought here but basically laws are just there incentivize/disincentivize certain behaviors in the best interest of society. In this model, a critic might say that if the law doesn’t succeed in convincing someone to obey then it failed. But it should be measured more broadly — how many people followed the law that wouldn’t have but for the law? The guide should be whether or not, on balance, the law produces more good behavior than bad. If 10% of cars on the road are driving irresponsibly that’s safer overall than if you have a Thunderdome world of abject chaos. </p> <p>And this doesn’t just have to be about “making a criminal not want to be a criminal.” When the country banned lawn darts that law didn’t make everyone want to stop playing lawn darts — but when the game stopped being on the shelves, a class of people who might have wanted it couldn’t get it and shrugged their shoulders and moved on. So fewer lawn dart matches regardless of what the individuals may have wanted. And there’s a whole other class of people who never would’ve ever cared about the game if they hadn’t seen it on the shelf in the first place. </p> <p>If we’re talking about gun regulations, how many people never get access to the gun because Walmart isn’t selling it or the manufacturers aren’t flooding the market with it?</p> <p>Another school of thought is that laws are just the reflection of the morals of society. In that model, murder is illegal because that’s what we aspire to and it doesn’t matter if it convinces anyone. Personally I don’t think that explains enough — what’s the moral code of parking tickets? But this is the philosophy, I think, of the gun crowd. They don’t want regulations because they know that shifts the moral frame of the nation to one that puts them on the outside so they complain that laws don’t matter to try and convince people not to make the moral pronouncement that casts them to the fringe of society. </p> <p>But no matter how you look at it, laws can’t be judged by who breaks them — that would literally be letting inmates run society.</p> <p>When I was a child growing up in the 1970s, mass shootings were rare. What we used to see in a decade, we now see in a six-month period. At that time, we also never saw anyone open carrying inside a Walmart, a Kroger, or anywhere else, for that matter. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/03/business/walmart-guns-ammunition-sales.html" title="">Walmart is “discouraging” open carry</a> in its stores, while <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/03/kroger-joins-walmart-asks-shoppers-not-to-openly-carry-guns-in-stores.html" title="">Kroger has asked its customers not to open carry </a>in their stores. This was something that just 20 years ago was unheard of. Now ,we are expected to see it as a legal right and nothing to fear? Really? How do I know the guy (and it is always a guy) carrying that AR-15 into McDonald’s is just there to buy a Big Mac? If your establishment allows open carry, I will no longer step foot in the door. This is where insurance companies need to step in: If you are a business and open to the public, and you allow open or concealed carry in your establishment, you should be paying astronomical insurance rates.</p> <p>In closing (and just to remind everyone why we are at this point), below is a list <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mass_shootings_in_the_United_States#List_of_mass_shootings_(2000%E2%80%93present)" title="">compiled by Wikipedia</a> of all the mass shootings in the United States since 2012. In the 1970s, there were a total of 14 mass shootings, and one of them was Kent State. In the 1980s, the number was 21. It is now September 2019 and we have already had 12 this year, with four months to go.</p> <p>We have a problem in this country and we need to address it, with strict gun control laws. If the gun activist crowd does not like it, well, they only have themselves to blame. There have been numerous chances to support and enact reasonable gun control laws. I am done with reasonable. Their paranoia over any law that could have prevented even one of these shootings has gotten us to this point, where we need to outlaw and ban these weapons. If they don’t like it, well, fuck them. They had their chance.</p> <table width="972"> <tr> <td> 2019 </td> <td> <p class="is-empty-p"></p> </td> <td> <p class="is-empty-p"></p> </td> <td> <p class="is-empty-p"></p> </td> <td> <p class="is-empty-p"></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Date</p> </td> <td> <p>Location</p> </td> <td> <p>Dead</p> </td> <td> <p>Injured</p> </td> <td> <p>Description</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>8/31/2019</p> </td> <td> <p>Midland–Odessa, Texas</p> </td> <td> <p>8</p> </td> <td> <p>25</p> </td> <td> <p>2019 West Texas shooting: Seven people were killed and twenty five  others were injured on the Interstate 20.

                    content: ' <p>This past week, Democratic presidential candidate and former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke put gun rights activists into a tizzy. He has proposed a ban on all assault weapons, a mandatory buyback of said rifles, and a voluntary buyback of <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/16/beto-orourke-buyback-gun-1466128">handguns</a>.</p> <p>Beto O’Rourke called Friday for gun licensing and a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons, expanding on a controversial gun control platform he advanced in his return to the presidential campaign the previous day.</p> <p>Part of a proposal to address gun violence and white nationalism, O’Rourke said that, if enacted, anyone who failed to forfeit a banned assault weapon would be fined.</p> In addition to banning assault weapons and requiring their forfeiture, O’Rourke said he would work to implement a voluntary buyback program for handguns. He proposed increasing the excise tax on gun manufacturers and fines on gun traffickers to fund buybacks. <p>Gun rights activists are sputtering all over Twitter, saying that every Democratic presidential candidate is in favor this proposal (which is not not true). The gun lovers also claim that this would entail confiscation of their firearms. That’s another obvious lie: If you are being given compensation for something, it is not confiscation. </p> <p>I have no sympathy for gun rights activists. They have turned our world upside down, without regard for the consequences. These are selfish people, only caring for their wants and treating gun ownership as an absolute right. It is not, and that part of the Second Amendment is often overlooked in regards to the debate over firearms. The entire text reads:</p> <p>"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."</p> <p>This is not talking about individual gun rights. It is talking about a militia, a militia that today is known as the National Guard. It also speaks of it being well-regulated. To argue that no laws can be imposed to restrict gun ownership is absurd. </p> <p>Gun rights activists could have avoided talk of gun buybacks and making certain weapon types illegal, had they just agreed to modest proposals about firearm safety. Had they not pushed and pushed for ever more lax laws, ee would not be at this point, where this is even a question. The rise in mass shootings is not because of mental health issues, it is not because of violent video games, nor is it because parents did not discipline their children. It is because of lax firearms laws, and easy access to guns that should not be in the hands of civilians.</p> <p>Gun rights activists will argue that the AR-15 and AK-47 rifles sold to the civilian market are not military firearms, as they do not fire fully automatic. Bullshit. I carried the M-16A1, and M-16A2, and have fired AK-47s. Their rate of fire, the ability to quickly change magazines, and the fact that their magazines can carry up to 100 rounds: those weapons aren’t something you use to hunt rabbits. That is a weapon that has one purpose: to kill and maim human beings. If you argue you need an AR-15 for hunting, you need a new hobby. Because you do not fire off 30 rounds in less than 30 seconds to shoot a rodent. If you want to argue that you need your AR-15 to protect yourself against a tyrannical U.S. government, I give you the M1A2 Abrams  </p> Trust me, your little peashooter isn’t even going to chip the paint on one of these. <p>I promise you, you are no match for that with your AR-15, or against the infantry that support it.</p> <p>The other argument that gun rights activists like to use is that criminals do not follow the law. I am not a lawyer, and I do not pretend to understand the nuances of law in society. So I asked <a href="https://abovethelaw.com/author/joe-patrice/?fbclid=IwAR3qgeVLEdYHqYBv5wCRJxvXNRMSKllAkkiwgwmt7VhmVfzVgDoW1TJqlkM" title="">Joe Patrice at Above the Law</a> about what laws are for, over and above preventing crime. This was his response:</p> <p>Someone is going to break every law. Criminals don’t follow laws against murder and no one suggests that’s a reason to legalize murder. </p> <p>There are a few schools of thought here but basically laws are just there incentivize/disincentivize certain behaviors in the best interest of society. In this model, a critic might say that if the law doesn’t succeed in convincing someone to obey then it failed. But it should be measured more broadly — how many people followed the law that wouldn’t have but for the law? The guide should be whether or not, on balance, the law produces more good behavior than bad. If 10% of cars on the road are driving irresponsibly that’s safer overall than if you have a Thunderdome world of abject chaos. </p> <p>And this doesn’t just have to be about “making a criminal not want to be a criminal.” When the country banned lawn darts that law didn’t make everyone want to stop playing lawn darts — but when the game stopped being on the shelves, a class of people who might have wanted it couldn’t get it and shrugged their shoulders and moved on. So fewer lawn dart matches regardless of what the individuals may have wanted. And there’s a whole other class of people who never would’ve ever cared about the game if they hadn’t seen it on the shelf in the first place. </p> <p>If we’re talking about gun regulations, how many people never get access to the gun because Walmart isn’t selling it or the manufacturers aren’t flooding the market with it?</p> <p>Another school of thought is that laws are just the reflection of the morals of society. In that model, murder is illegal because that’s what we aspire to and it doesn’t matter if it convinces anyone. Personally I don’t think that explains enough — what’s the moral code of parking tickets? But this is the philosophy, I think, of the gun crowd. They don’t want regulations because they know that shifts the moral frame of the nation to one that puts them on the outside so they complain that laws don’t matter to try and convince people not to make the moral pronouncement that casts them to the fringe of society. </p> <p>But no matter how you look at it, laws can’t be judged by who breaks them — that would literally be letting inmates run society.</p> <p>When I was a child growing up in the 1970s, mass shootings were rare. What we used to see in a decade, we now see in a six-month period. At that time, we also never saw anyone open carrying inside a Walmart, a Kroger, or anywhere else, for that matter. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/03/business/walmart-guns-ammunition-sales.html" title="">Walmart is “discouraging” open carry</a> in its stores, while <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/03/kroger-joins-walmart-asks-shoppers-not-to-openly-carry-guns-in-stores.html" title="">Kroger has asked its customers not to open carry </a>in their stores. This was something that just 20 years ago was unheard of. Now ,we are expected to see it as a legal right and nothing to fear? Really? How do I know the guy (and it is always a guy) carrying that AR-15 into McDonald’s is just there to buy a Big Mac? If your establishment allows open carry, I will no longer step foot in the door. This is where insurance companies need to step in: If you are a business and open to the public, and you allow open or concealed carry in your establishment, you should be paying astronomical insurance rates.</p> <p>In closing (and just to remind everyone why we are at this point), below is a list <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mass_shootings_in_the_United_States#List_of_mass_shootings_(2000%E2%80%93present)" title="">compiled by Wikipedia</a> of all the mass shootings in the United States since 2012. In the 1970s, there were a total of 14 mass shootings, and one of them was Kent State. In the 1980s, the number was 21. It is now September 2019 and we have already had 12 this year, with four months to go.</p> <p>We have a problem in this country and we need to address it, with strict gun control laws. If the gun activist crowd does not like it, well, they only have themselves to blame. There have been numerous chances to support and enact reasonable gun control laws. I am done with reasonable. Their paranoia over any law that could have prevented even one of these shootings has gotten us to this point, where we need to outlaw and ban these weapons. If they don’t like it, well, fuck them. They had their chance.</p> <table width="972"> <tr> <td> 2019 </td> <td> <p class="is-empty-p"></p> </td> <td> <p class="is-empty-p"></p> </td> <td> <p class="is-empty-p"></p> </td> <td> <p class="is-empty-p"></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Date</p> </td> <td> <p>Location</p> </td> <td> <p>Dead</p> </td> <td> <p>Injured</p> </td> <td> <p>Description</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>8/31/2019</p> </td> <td> <p>Midland–Odessa, Texas</p> </td> <td> <p>8</p> </td> <td> <p>25</p> </td> <td> <p>2019 West Texas shooting: Seven people were killed and twenty five  others were injured on the Interstate 20.

Wilkerson was 27 years old. He and his fiancee, Rose Walters, were trying to save money to pay for their approaching wedding, and after aging out of eligibility for coverage under his father’s insurance, Wilkerson was having a terrible time trying to afford his insulin costs.
